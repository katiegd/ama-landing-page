# ama-landing-page

Full-Stack Developer - Take-Home Assignment

I have prepared a concise landing webpage/application that integrates with Mistral API that generates an environmental report based on the date, Location, Air Quality, and water pH of the area.

To set up and run this application locally, clone the repository using

git clone git@github.com:katiegd/ama-landing-page.git

Navigate to ama-landing-page in your terminal. You will need to run the server in order to connect to the server. Type

node app

into the terminal. You are now connected to the server.

To fun the front end, open a new terminal window and run:

npm run dev

You will have your front end up on http://localhost:5173.

You should now be able to generate reports!
